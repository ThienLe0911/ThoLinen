          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p className="uppermedium_text mt-5">
            Founded in 2002, SWAG is the brainchild of a group of fashion
            enthusiasts who shared a common dream.
          </p>
          <p className="medium_text mt-5">
            Our founders, Nick and Jeena, were driven by a deep love for fashion
            and a desire to provide people with clothing that allows them to
            shine and stand out in a crowded world of fashion. What started as a
            small-scale endeavor has now grown into a renowned fashion brand
            with a global presence. Our commitment to quality, innovation, and
            customer satisfaction has propelled us to the forefront of the
            fashion industry.

          <p className="uppermedium_text mt-5">
            At SWAG, we believe that fashion is not just about what you wear,
            but how it makes you feel. Itâ€™s a powerful form of self-expression
            and an art that speaks volumes without uttering a word. Our
            philosophy is grounded in the following principles:
